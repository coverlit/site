<h3>What</h3>

<p>We publish fiction and poetry.</p>
<p>We pay $25 per accepted piece.</p>
<p>We have no affiliation with <a href="https://covermagnyc.com/">this magazine</a> but it looks like it was cool and was founded the year I (Ryan) was born.</p>


<h3>Who</h3>

<p>Hanna Shea edits poetry. "I want to read poems that make space for incompatibility, disunion, chaos. Also poems about the rocks and clouds near your home."</p>
<p><a href="https://ryanshea.info">Ryan Shea</a> edits fiction. "I want to publish work that gives a shit, that is not afraid to move, that is paying attention, but to something else."</p>


<h3>How</h3>

<p>Include the title(s) and your name in the subject line.</p>
<p>Add the work as an attachment (doc, pdf, whatever makes sense).</p>
