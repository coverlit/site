<h4>What</h4>

<p>We publish fiction and poetry.</p>

<p>We pay $25 per accepted piece.</p>

<p>We have no affiliation with <a href="https://covermagnyc.com/">this magazine</a> but it looks like it was cool and was founded the year I (Ryan) was born.</p>


<h4>Who</h4>

<p>Hanna Shea edits poetry. "I want to read poems that make space for incompatibility, disunion, chaos. Also poems about the rocks and clouds near your home."</p>

<p><a href="https://ryanshea.info">Ryan Shea</a> edits fiction. "I want to publish work that gives a shit, that is not afraid to move, that is paying attention, but to something else."</p>


<h4>How</h4>

<p>Email submissions to coverlitmag@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Include the title(s) and your name in the subject line.</p>

<p>Add the work as an attachment (doc, pdf, whatever makes sense).</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll ask for a short bio on acceptance.</p>

<p>Please submit with the knowledge that we will likely have edits.</p>
