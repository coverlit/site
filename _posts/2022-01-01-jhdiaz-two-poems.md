<h3>The Wolf</h3>
A wolf howled with the wind. It was the beginning of autumn. The wolf’s eyes are the color of coffee. The rest of his pack was resting by a creek. The wolf decided to let them rest while it went for a morning walk. It walked around a small mountain range. Later, it found a field of dandelions. It frolicked in the field, smelling plenty of flowers. It began to rain. The wolf decided to hunt a rabbit on its own. It figured it would be more stealth to go on its own. It found some bushes and patiently waited behind a rock. A family of rabbits eventually appeared. The wolf pounced and grabbed two of the rabbits by the throat. The wolf ate one of the rabbits and brought the other back to the pack. The wolf took a shortcut back to the creek through some rocky hills. It wasn’t intimidated by the rain or the hills. It soldiered on. When it got back to the creek, the wolves were swimming in the water in the light rain. They sprinted to the wolf’s side with the dead rabbit in its mouth. The wolf gave the pack the dead rabbit and went for a swim. It stopped raining as the sun set and the moon began to shine.

<h3>The Bald Eagle</h3>
A bald eagle soared over a river; it was late-summer. The countryside was in the background. Aspens and oaks lined the landscape. A few goats frolicked beneath the eagle by the river. They were accompanied by a herder with a shotgun. Then, suddenly, the bald eagle darted to the ground and snatched up a rabbit by a bush. It bit into its tender neck and ate most of the flesh. The clouds thickened; it began to rain. At sunset, the bald eagle returned to its nest and fed its eaglets. The moon climbed the sky with the clouds.
