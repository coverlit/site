<h3>These Stories Are True</h3>
1.
The first thing is the most
important thing.
Only you care—
I don’t. I want something

good, hard,
shamefully obvious.

Picture millions of women
violated.

The intentions point to need.
Listen, I am the truth.

People deserve
to be let down.

2.
I have a lot.
I’m beyond.
I did owe him.
I carried him.
All these years.
Fueled by privacy.
Women have loved.
Men choose.
To live.
I want my own.

3.
I came
when I learned
anyone
needed
my absence.

All women
regret
hope.

Speak louder,
trust me.

I want,
and I plan.

I need
that anger.

My President,
perhaps I disappoint.

4.
huge        

<span class="indent-2">huge</span>


<span class="indent-1">enormous</span>
long


<span class="indent-1">often</span>


predator

<span class="indent-3">my flaws</span>

5.
True,
I never learned
that power.

Asking
isn’t a question.

These women—
I have
run from them.

I left
these women
cautious, disabled.

They tried,
I think,
to forgive,
which is nothing
to me,
a man given
to hurt.

And I can
hurt them all.

I love you,
my only
anguish:

people who have given me
anything I want.
