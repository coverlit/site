<p>Starting April 1, we're evolving. Below is a list of changes and why we made them. If you have any questions, you know where to find us.</p>

<h3>1: Paying $25 per accepted piece.</h3>

<p>The web is a promising place for writers. Web journals should provide concrete delivery on that promise in many forms. One form is respect. We believe that paying for a story is a basic point of respect for writing we love. It raises the stake for the writers submitting and for us as editors. We will not waste money.</p>

<p>Also, we work decent paying jobs for corporations. If we can be barnacles on these large systems of capital, we want some of that money to go to writers and into the writing community (whatever that means, maybe buy some indie press books with the pay).</p>

<h3>2: Site Remodel</h3>

<p>We were paying for web hosting and now we're getting it for free using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. The new design is functional, in our control, and reflects our vision. As we learn more, we might have some ways of building out projects that seem exciting to us (thinking about work like web-based novellas, interactive stories, and other simple ways to use a website). Also, the coverlitmag.com url felt outdated and long. Everything we published will be moved over to the new site in time.</p>

<h3>3: Submissions</h3>

<p>We're going to accept submissions as we have been, on a rolling basis and always open. If we get more than we can handle, we'll move over to submission windows.</p>
