<div class="poem">
 “The dead looked dead, the living looked alive.”

Blood on the terrace lost
<span class="indent-2">to its body, body elsewhere</span>
<span class="indent-2">lost but only seven percent or so</span>
the first thought came. Left
<span class="indent-2">the scene in hopes to catch a breath</span>
<span class="indent-2">of ice smog between draws</span>
for bargain price, to virtue, the label
<span class="indent-2">lay its claim. Across whose thresh</span>
<span class="indent-2">hold and at what hour can I,</span>
in the unseeing, see? In shades of pre
<span class="indent-2">dawn but post-slumber to which</span>
<span class="indent-2">I was not privy. Blood on the terrace</span>
where, like every name told me over
<span class="indent-2">the night, passed as though wax</span>
<span class="indent-2">sealed, the I becomes irrelevant</span>
to the gestures it makes. Just nod to look
<span class="indent-2">interested I swore I would</span>
<span class="indent-2">but on a choke chain necklace</span>
kept my pride, matched the dress
<span class="indent-2">formal enough for cocktail attire.</span>
<span class="indent-2">All floor gaze in dog tag</span>
Adornment, fatigue motif hinted
<span class="indent-2">in the shift. No shit I couldn’t</span>
<span class="indent-2">engage the civilians, could only</span>
see myself in name brand spec
<span class="indent-2">reflections. Couldn’t but trace</span>
<span class="indent-2">the flight of translucent globes</span>
in miniature from champagne flutes
<span class="indent-2">to become nothing-- or what</span>
<span class="indent-2">there was worth toasting. Room</span>
packed, conquest quarantined within. Gun
<span class="indent-2"> blank expression proved too self</span>
<span class="indent-2">-involved to shoot off song titles</span>
some face claimed played across
<span class="indent-2">our shared presence at a past time.</span>
<span class="indent-2">I didn’t ask to be this way. Left the scene,</span>
standing how many erect necks now
<span class="indent-2">above the bustle? Above how many</span>
<span class="indent-2">apartments that I could, for a lark,</span>
occupy by the hour and water
<span class="indent-2">-mark with blood as my own? Still</span>
<span class="indent-2">life goes on on the first terrace</span>
I step to out of this long night, brim
<span class="indent-2">-stone hearth-sat sulking. I wish I had</span>
<span class="indent-2">a robe. A butcher’s knife, a torn out</span>
canto, a Caravaggio: shrapnel
<span class="indent-2">motifs I paint in memory of what occurs</span>
<span class="indent-2">in the here-now on a stranger’s porch</span>
frame in sliding door relief. I touch
<span class="indent-2">my coat and the touch dries rough</span>
<span class="indent-2">as impasto on print. The loss</span>
my own, or not, I can’t tell. When
<span class="indent-2">I swallow where my neck would be,</span>
<span class="indent-2">it not so much as ripples air.</span>
A nosebleed, a severed head, a hang
<span class="indent-2">-over. What difference could it make</span>
<span class="indent-2">to look down in blackout?</span>
My jeweled hand, I call her Judith.
<span class="indent-2">On this high terrace, this once</span>
<span class="indent-2">neckline, Holofernes. Suicide</span>
of the social follows the body at war
<span class="indent-2">with mind. None can sever the light</span>
<span class="indent-2">from the light-headed only shouldered.</span>
