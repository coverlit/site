She is the co-founder of the arts collective HAIR CLUB, a collaborative, research-based initiative on the topic of HAIR in our wider culture. Suzanne currently teaches Art History in the Visual Arts Department at the Baltimore School for the Arts and operates FuzzyMuzzle Design, a freelance design firm.
