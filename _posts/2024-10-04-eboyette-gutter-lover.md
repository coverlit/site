<div class="poem">
Eaten by a creature of summer,

  bummer. In a sec I savor a water

    melon jolly rancher. Dancing 


tonally livid vapors simmer 

  around my knee highs and I 

    press a deer skull in beer. 


Rest you must my little purple

  finch, cockroach dribble of 

    gilded inches croaking up 


from sick buttercups. You

  and I are facts in riptides,

    seismic beige the most outrageous


Lascaux with a quinine sky. 

  Buried vertically she thought

    Over my dead bod. You are nodding


off while I scare squirrels and eat

  pearls so guess it’s bliss 

    and should I forget the humming 


bird cake, should I forget the neutered 

  scarves, should I forget the laser

    surgery one performed on my 


empty apparatus of Dracula teeth, 

  let me remember your eye sockets 

    falling across my leather backpack 


and asking “is something wet?” 

  It always soaks up the diversions

    into something akin to rhubarb


blood. I’m not hungry for anything

  when the apps restrict my cells

    from chaotic crushes into ether


and neither are you, neon 

  yo-yo dog walker ‘cross bog

    waters turned pink. In a dream 


my cousin was possessed and no 

  one cared. You, dumb infant, 

    deceit is perverse like a piercing.


If you reckon then you reverse, curse

  A knife wound to dote, remote, corner

    of lambs sheered into gutter fluff. 


All I need to know is could it be enough

  to live in the filth of what made us soft?
