<div class="poem">
Eaten by a creature of summer,

<span class="indent-1">bummer. In a sec I savor a water</span>

<span class="indent-2">melon jolly rancher. Dancing</span>


tonally livid vapors simmer 

<span class="indent-1">around my knee highs and I</span>

<span class="indent-2">press a deer skull in beer.</span>


Rest you must my little purple

<span class="indent-1">finch, cockroach dribble of</span>

<span class="indent-2">gilded inches croaking up</span>


from sick buttercups. You

<span class="indent-1">and I are facts in riptides,</span>

<span class="indent-2">seismic beige the most outrageous</span>


Lascaux with a quinine sky. 

<span class="indent-1">Buried vertically she thought</span>

<span class="indent-2">Over my dead bod. You are nodding</span>


off while I scare squirrels and eat

<span class="indent-1">pearls so guess it’s bliss</span>

<span class="indent-2">and should I forget the humming</span>


bird cake, should I forget the neutered 

<span class="indent-1">scarves, should I forget the laser</span>

<span class="indent-2">surgery one performed on my</span>


empty apparatus of Dracula teeth, 

<span class="indent-1">let me remember your eye sockets</span>

<span class="indent-2">falling across my leather backpack</span>


and asking “is something wet?” 

<span class="indent-1">It always soaks up the diversions</span>

<span class="indent-2">into something akin to rhubarb</span>


blood. I’m not hungry for anything

<span class="indent-1">when the apps restrict my cells</span>

<span class="indent-2">from chaotic crushes into ether</span>


and neither are you, neon 

<span class="indent-1">yo-yo dog walker ‘cross bog</span>

<span class="indent-2">waters turned pink. In a dream</span>


my cousin was possessed and no 

<span class="indent-1">one cared. You, dumb infant,</span>

<span class="indent-2">deceit is perverse like a piercing.</span>


If you reckon then you reverse, curse

<span class="indent-1">A knife wound to dote, remote, corner</span>

<span class="indent-2">of lambs sheered into gutter fluff.</span>


All I need to know is could it be enough

<span class="indent-1">to live in the filth of what made us soft?</span>
