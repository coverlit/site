<div class="poem">
<h3>Glow is Due Mainly to the Presence of Dinoflagellates</h3>

Stacks of profanity dry on newspaper
while light disappears from eyes
voices green unguarded


cradle wolves or walk
into symphonies repeatable
by virtue of technology


The wolves and the walking
and the sun falling are never


facsimiles though they resemble
their sisters
 

<h3>Of Derelicts and Wreckage</h3>

One card for each question
fool, star, magician


Who are you; we who
worry return


Paint what we cannot say
love of the objectionable


is another form of silence
grown so many hands
