<div class="poem">
The little entrance

seemed smaller than

a table.

*

Every day was

a birthday.

*

My sister was

a miser.

*

The floor lived in its 

leather enclosure. 

*

The floor 

caved in.

*

There will be 

no questions.

This Is An Awkward Monster
I have made 

every mistake.

*

I have accumulated

the coldest nausea.

*

My outstretched hand, its 

curving fingernail: these 

are the only objects. They

are not flowers.

*

Their sound

is sickening.
