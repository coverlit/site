<div class="poem">
Overtilling in the fields
sends vibrations through
earth stilling basin over
flows disrupted unstilled

What they did they did without
merit stilted swallowing
unclear throat

Thinking not knowing still
expecting everything they
desired and thought
they deserved

Now they extract blood from
the coffers expecting rain
Alchemy doesn’t work
that way
