<p>Overtilling in the fields\\

sends vibrations through\\

earth stilling basin over\\

flows disrupted unstilled\\</p>

<p>What they did they did without\\

merit stilted swallowing\\

unclear throat\\</p>

<p>Thinking not knowing still\\

expecting everything they\\

desired and thought\\

they deserved\\</p>

<p>Now they extract blood from\\

the coffers expecting rain\\

Alchemy doesn’t work\\

that way\\</p>
