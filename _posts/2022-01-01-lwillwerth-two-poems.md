<h3>If I Run</h3>
Good evening

thank you very much

I speak to you today

as a true friend

I’m going to tell you

a couple of stories

I didn’t come here

to pander

folks, believe me

believe me

oh, believe me

I am a newcomer

hey, I have lobbyists

I have so many websites

I have them all over the place

I have more accountants than I have nurses

I was the grand marshal of the parade

many people turned down this honor

I did not

I don’t care

I’m really rich

that sounds crass

it’s not crass

by the way

I think I’m a nice person

I think I’m actually a very nice person

does my family like me?

I think so, right

I did them early and young

special, special

wow

whoa

do you want to hear something really shocking?

my daughter, ivanka, is about to have a beautiful jewish baby

I have known him for many years and we’ll be able to work closely together

I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks

listening to him negotiate

but he wasn’t a cheerleader

he’s actually a negative force

I said, is he intelligent?

which brings me to my next point

we’re always losing all this gorgeous brand-new stuff

terrible, terrible situation

deplorable, deplorable situation

a catastrophe and a disaster

a disaster called the big lie

it’s tough it’s nasty it’s mean it’s vicious it’s beautiful

when you win it’s beautiful

we have a hospital ready just in case

there’s nothing wrong with that, right?

if I run

if I run

I’m running
