<div class="poem">
Orange precludes blue
<span class="indent-3">wavelengths in this</span>
nonaquarium but for
balloon cuttlefish
children and their
adults in tandem
lob so that
they float to the ceiling
then back to the
floor. In this
I am
a yeast reaction. I propagate
myself with glycerin
in pistons

and flasks
and lambent floral
and clangs on two grand
pianos and include
a plant
who thinks
it's a man
wearing a blurry
nametag and a suit and thumbing
the screen on his phone
to take a photo
of our moving
towards him and then
changing course
