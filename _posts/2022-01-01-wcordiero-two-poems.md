<h3>Golder Age</h3>
“Antiquity held too light thoughts from objects of mortality, while some drew provocations of mirth from anatomies, and jugglers showed tricks with skeletons; when fiddlers made not so pleasant mirth as fencers, and men could sit with quiet  stomachs, while hanging was played before them.” 

—Sir Thomas Browne, Hydriotaphia  

Floggings, stonings, stocks, and racks
constitute our daily entertainments; witches 
burn; thieves hang; heretics are screwed 
tighter into their Judas chairs and murderers 
beheaded. Écorchés in anatomy books, 
hipshot and leering, hold up the fabric of 
their own flayed skins. Our engravings, 
paintings, and other crafts likewise cram 
with cracked skulls and moldered books, an 
astrolabe or hourglass. Desiccated fruit; 
meat-slabs draped from butcher’s hooks; 
guttering candles; mandolins with missing 
frets. Ruins, shadows, cobwebs, mirrors, 
medicaments. Fresh corpses heap in 
trundling plague-carts—and even those still 
expiring with some faint breath get lumped 
helter-skelter in great stinking carcass pits. 
Plague masks confused for some saucepot’s 
Venetian domino at Carnevale. Riots, lust, 
revenge. Cesspools of offal, vomit, horse 
droppings trickle through thoroughfares as 
wenches empty chamber-pots out windows. 
Orange-sellers and cutpurses circulate our 
tragedies. Tumblers and zanies, fire-eaters, 
bone-jugglers, and chin-players perform 
during entr’actes. Puddles of blood scab 
over black as an old spittoon brimming with 
pine-tar from so many backstreet duels; 
dogfights; bear-baitings. Linkboys will gladly 
light you down blind alleys to lice-ridden 
Molls or Molly houses. Apothecaries 
prescribe salamander wool, henbane, and 
mercury. Ladies take to powder and 
patchboxes; gentlemen to their potations. 
We train up war dogs and mercenary sailors. 
Scholars retreat to quibble about classical 
errata or rhubarb the grammar on an 
entablature from a dead language. 
Marshalling the fulsome wit of human 
reason, preachers of  every persuasion 
commend this life to the obliquity of despair
—as good for nothing except to purge us of 
all earthly dross by means of philosophizing 
on our coming doom, whereof even their 
noisome antic is but a mummer’s dance 
kicking up old dust. But no, we have no 
gladiators, no crucifixions, no human 
sacrifices, no cannibals, no savage rites, no 
Turkish harems, no acupuncture, no worship 
of animals, no head-shrinking, no—none of 
that.

<h3>Mr. Figure Vows to Start a Diet</h3>
Victorian ladies once ate tapeworms. 
Analogously, Mr. Figure imagines himself a 
dark-eyed, death-haunted Ophelia, 
swallowing slimy earthworms and 
pullulating maggots, salamanders, and
nematodes — not after drowning in a lake, 
but rather as a walking cure over the course 
of several years so as to decay and molder 
from the inside out. Transform himself into a 
hunger artist, a living skeleton, a spectacle of 
freakish self-discipline. Starve himself of 
worldly splendor in an askesis of bodily 
negation. The self no more than an epigraph, 
a glyph. Absent of balderdash and ballyhoo, 
no part amorphous, a rib-racked matrix of 
containment and control, signifying nothing. 
Well. Not quite right now, though — 
tomorrow and tomorrow. Mr. Figure wobbles 
around, from one paper-thin fantasy to 
another, without any definite shape.
