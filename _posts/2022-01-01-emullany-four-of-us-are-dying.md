<div class="story">
At first it’s just me, walking down a long dark corridor, in silence. Then I realize there’s a person walking beside me, though I don’t know how long this person has been walking beside me, and I don’t know, either, if this person knows that I am walking beside them. Finally we are approached by two other people, who have been walking toward us from some distance away, and who pass us in silence, in the hall, continuing in the direction from which we have come, though it’s true that we also are passing them, and that, from their perspective, we had been approaching, and they had been the ones who were being approached.
