<h3>I Want to Know About Nighthawks</h3>
"I’ve never been Edward Hopper,           but every night               when I empty my spam folder 

I want to know             what my internet knows              of my urges       I don’t 

open any of my emails                            my curse/r drifts             within the world of the screen 

nothing touches me                  I’m offended                    by nothingness                I refuse 

to research how he researched the diner            so I cannot 

be sure of closeness       gliding I            become             across the screen the desire to be trans/ 

planted             fear touches my body    I touch my face             parts of me are empty/her 

my ex-wife        texts to say I should go                           to Chicago to visit the painting 

but I live in Iowa          and have never been      through a toll    alone                 so I 

change all my screen   savers to pictures            of nights              or hawks 

or any cross between the two"
