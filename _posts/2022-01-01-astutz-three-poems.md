<h3>Promotional Campaign</h3>
Live from somewhere—

anywhere—	oh shit— help us—

Bring finales!			          Brattling swords!

                                                  Bleaker prospects!

				                  Blunt force!

Window-less 	in this theater

(fastidious 	merchandizer

of malodorous

meanderings of 

malformed 	leeches +

rambling thoughts:		  sunflower wrecks					

                                                  worm-like wax

                                                  the weeks

of usury travel			  filled w/ extortions

+ columnar falsehoods		

+ colloquial distractions			

denting			                  the armor’s thick skin. 

                                                  The fields are gnawing 

                                                  w/ cold

+ we have arrived	

at the superfluous

structure of failed

					

dialogue			          (lighter fluid 

					          mistaken for 

compassion.

Check the gritting teeth		      (the last self-portrait

the dash crash rabble 		running up

                                                tabs + talk-talk—

the world’s a word

too expansive			for the small cuts

on my finger

                                                 but it’s still		

                                                 a world evolving.

To pull the line 		         from the syllables

                                                 I see bobbing 		

                                                 on the horizon

                                                 half-sleep

my fish 		             mouth 

finds dangling in the 		brackish

                                                swimming pool

           of my hopes		where I forward

           matters			displaced by a loose survival

                                                mechanism.

The levity of simple breezes	

(new shelter 			         “an eyelash lining		

a cheek like a prayer”—		

                                                        is the morbidity	

that comes from breathing  	for one more minute.

<h3>Fifty-Nine Minutes</h3>
The next campaign	   is a wave—

             a wanton window 

into the old century’s 		      viciousness.

             As we arrive

the same    	   omnipresent questions 	

                           once worn 	       in brocades

on the chest 	remain		(the republic.

            We still continue

to fall slowly 	into embellishment +

            the stains of years

punctuating 	                      the decorated gangway 

of hallucinations

                            in faulty promise.

                                             Our stooped shoulders 

form 			             a means to an end—

a canvas of scars penned 

                             w/ the kinds of anxieties 

only night words can bring.

To	      comprehend 

                                             creeping         loudness

+ sickness colored-in	at the edges—

               the hollow skins + parentage 

singing in glorious    	     techno-babble.

                                             It’s all pulled from	

the demagogue garbage collection.

              It’s pushing along 

malignancies in 		             a pandemic of papercuts.

We love 		                   the romance 

we fabricate		           under false justice

embedded 		           in constituency— 

                          we lay disarray like art into

ad campaigns 

                            + re-design our vessels

into pigeon calls—	  an electric bleakness. 

We are a heated condition 	

                                          of tiny hand 

blowhards brandishing 	    hate as commodity—

dressed up as 	affection for the consumer—

                                            a remuneration 

              collected in votes.

We now build 

simple fishbowls 

in seconds +	

            new fevers + seraphim 

                        w/their plucked-out wings

                                                 (cracked + violent.

We melt into strangers.

                          We step up 

                                      the soft tissue wounds

conceived in sewn-up 

                                                  languages.

Onward	              we are the march 

            of clipped wings—

                        steered by a lost navigator 

+ we become inquiries 	  	    + a blueprint 

for the new mourning 

                          where the faces 

                                      we hang in the closet

 fail to ever settle our overrun life.

                                       We continue to nurture 

            iniquities          running

up the clock face—

	waiting out the period

                                    for fifty-nine minutes 

                                                                to end.

<h3>Development</h3>
I hold the dear brilliance	of my shining anxiety

in the waiting room: 	familiar line in tow:

I am teetering 	(don’t slip 

office: a familiar worship room:	I plant 					

my irritation in an upright chair I can trace 			

w/ my eyes closed:

Roughly: an affirmation 	on a coffee mug			

is towing a familiar freeway +

the desire for the first night:	a kitchen song		

latched in a moribund 	envelope of necessity:

into spin cycle	high-end programming 	

for all of my imagined	dramas:	

the violence of skins

gate closing/a protection:	

unspent measure	of molar grinding

The decay of my teeth:	the sculpting 	

of dereliction	+ sporting cardigans:	

I imagine a small balloon		

of sex nests next to me	slumbering down:	

(two lines I skipped       I yield to false images

a million miles:	a love	 a silence of desire

that needs to shriek 	yes: progress
