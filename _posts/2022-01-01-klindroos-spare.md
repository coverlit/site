<div class="poem">
You can buy a Roman coin for four dollars actually
a dollar ninety-five plus two dollars shipping

which means that it costs more to ship
the Roman coin than the coin is worth which means

the three day shipment from Toledo to Boston
is more valuable than the shipment from Rome to Toledo

which took 1500 years, you could say the coin now
is the opposite of money, its face worn such that 

should you clean it there would be nothing there
underneath, no face, and money always needs

a type of face, arguably the coin looks better
when left caked in the hardened accumulation

of years, though this accumulation may be false,
though most seeking to buy wish to remove this

as to judge clearly the merit of artifact,
though such actions serve only to sever the item

from the origin being judged so as to force then a certain imagining, 

anyway the reviews say don't bother you can't see the face,
the reviews say I love it I feel connected to the past, the reviews say

don't trust the seller, they ask if it comes with the slip
that verifies it is true, a slip that in lieu of hardened dirt

and other accumulations will prove the passage of time with authority
not questioned nor named, and with this the value

is placed elsewhere yet again, so that you are not sure what value is
besides an idea, an idea related to the possibility of the coinâ€™s

second forging, which is almost more impressive than the first, this
process by which we satisfy our desires with falsehood,

by which all dirt can somehow look the same as its presence
is both an elemental wish and sanction
